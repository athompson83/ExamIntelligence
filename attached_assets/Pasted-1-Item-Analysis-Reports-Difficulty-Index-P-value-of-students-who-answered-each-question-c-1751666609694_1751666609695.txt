1️⃣ Item Analysis Reports
	•	Difficulty Index (P-value) – % of students who answered each question correctly.
	•	Discrimination Index – How well a question differentiates between high- and low-performing students.
	•	Point-Biserial Correlation – Correlation between getting the question right and overall exam score.
	•	Distractor Analysis – How often incorrect options were chosen (effectiveness of distractors).

⸻

2️⃣ Test Reliability & Validity Analytics
	•	Cronbach’s Alpha / KR-20 / KR-21 – Measures internal consistency (reliability) of the test.
	•	Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) – Estimates the expected range of error in individual scores.
	•	Content validity mapping – Alignment of questions to objectives, competencies, or guidelines.

⸻

3️⃣ Performance & Outcome Reports
	•	Score distribution report – Visualizes how students performed (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
	•	Pass/fail rates – % of students achieving passing thresholds.
	•	Gradebook export – Individual and group performance summary.
	•	Mastery reports – % of students meeting learning objectives or competencies.

⸻

4️⃣ Question Bank Health & Utilization Reports
	•	Question usage frequency – How often each question is used.
	•	Question lifecycle tracking – When questions were created, last reviewed, or retired.
	•	Question validation status – When each question was last validated or linked to updated guidelines.

⸻

5️⃣ Learner Behavior & Engagement Analytics
	•	Time-on-question data – How long learners spend on individual questions.
	•	Time-per-test analytics – Average test completion time, time distribution across sections.
	•	Question skipping patterns – Which items are most skipped or returned to.

⸻

6️⃣ Adaptive & AI Analytics (if supported)
	•	AI confidence metrics – AI-estimated confidence in each question’s quality or alignment.
	•	Adaptive path reporting – If using adaptive testing, the path taken by learners through the question set.

⸻

7️⃣ Cohort & Comparative Analytics
	•	Cohort comparison reports – Compare performance across classes, groups, or demographics.
	•	Pre- vs post-test analysis – Tracks learning gains between initial and final assessments.
	•	Benchmarking reports – Compare against national norms or external standards.

⸻

8️⃣ Flagged Question & Error Reports
	•	High-miss-rate flagging – Identifies questions with excessive wrong answers.
	•	Anomalous response pattern detection – Highlights possible issues like flawed questions or cheating.
	•	Feedback flag tracking – Reports on questions flagged by users for review.

⸻

9️⃣ Remediation & Learning Needs Reports
	•	Weakness mapping by competency – Identifies areas where individuals or cohorts need remediation.
	•	Remediation action tracking – Links follow-up assignments or interventions to assessment data.

⸻

10️⃣ Compliance & Accreditation Reports
	•	Standards mapping report – Demonstrates alignment to accrediting body requirements (e.g., NREMT, CAPCE).
	•	Competency attainment tracking – Links exams to required skills or knowledge domains.

⸻

📊 Recommended Visualizations for These Reports

✅ Heatmaps (for distractor selection, time spent)
✅ Boxplots / histograms (for score distributions)
✅ Trend lines (performance over time)
✅ Radar charts (competency attainment)
✅ Tables with color-coded indicators (e.g., red for problem questions)

⸻

📝 Bonus: Advanced Metrics (if system supports AI/ML)
	•	Sentiment analysis of free-text responses
	•	Predictive analytics (e.g., who is at risk of failing)
	•	Correlation of performance to other factors (attendance, participation, etc.)

⸻

💡 Actionable Use
	•	Prioritize regular review of item analysis and question validation reports to keep exams defensible.
	•	Use cohort analytics and mastery reports for curriculum improvement.
	•	Integrate remediation reports into continuous quality improvement (CQI) plans.
	•	Ensure compliance reports are ready for internal and external audits.
