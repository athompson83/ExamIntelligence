Develop an intuitive editor for content creators with rich text, media uploads, and inline validations.

C. Quiz Creation, Settings, and Adaptive Testing
Quiz Builder Interface:

Allow educators to name quizzes, configure time limits, shuffling options, and navigation settings.

Adaptive Testing Engine:

Build logic workflows that adjust question difficulty in real time, based on responses and pre-set thresholds.

Randomization & Grouping:

Develop mechanisms for random selection from question groups and randomizing answer order.

Security Settings:

Implement password protection, IP locking, and timed access controls.

D. AI-Powered Resources
Study Guides & Lecture Notes Generation:

Utilize external AI APIs to generate content summaries and detailed guides.

Integrate multimedia support (videos, images, hyperlinks) for enriched content.

Personalized Improvement Plans:

After exam completion, trigger workflows that analyze student performance and generate targeted recommendations.

E. Exam Hosting and Monitoring
Exam Scheduler:

Build scheduling interfaces for setting start/end times and exam windows.

Proctoring Tools Integration:

Incorporate real-time monitoring APIs to flag unusual behaviors (e.g., rapid answer changes, navigation issues).

Adaptive Navigation Controls:

Create workflows that manage question progression based on adaptive testing logic.

F. Dashboards and Roles
Teacher Dashboard:

Develop pages to manage testbanks, quizzes, monitor live exam activity, and view AI-generated suggestions.

Student Dashboard:

Design interfaces for accessing assigned quizzes, viewing results, and reviewing improvement plans.

Role-Based Access Control:

Use Bubble’s built-in user management to restrict features and data access based on user roles.

G. Analytics and Insights
Data Visualization:

Integrate charting plugins to display graphs on performance trends, question analytics, and time usage.

Real-Time Reporting:

Build workflows that aggregate data at the question, quiz, and overall exam levels.

Feedback Loops:

Implement mechanisms for recommending question revisions or improvements based on collected analytics.

H. Additional Features
Multi-Language Support:

Utilize Bubble’s multi-language capabilities to support internationalization.

Export & Integration:
