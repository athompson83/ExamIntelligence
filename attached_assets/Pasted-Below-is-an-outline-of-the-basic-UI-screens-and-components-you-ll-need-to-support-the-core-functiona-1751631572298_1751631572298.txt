3. General UI Considerations
Responsive & Adaptive Layouts:

Use Bubble’s responsive design features to adjust layouts for different screen sizes and device types.

Design separate layouts if necessary—one optimized for desktop teacher administration and another simplified for test takers on mobile.

Consistent Visual Language:

Maintain a cohesive branding style across all pages using consistent color schemes, typography, and iconography.

Utilize visual cues (badges, alerts, tooltips) to help users identify key actions and statuses (e.g., flagged questions or live exam alerts).

Usability & Accessibility:

Ensure all interactive elements are clearly labeled and accessible.

Provide contextual help or tooltips for complex features (such as adaptive testing rules or AI feedback panels).

Integration of AI Feedback:

Clearly display AI insights in the question editor and analytics pages using cards or panels that highlight recommended changes or flagged issues.

Allow users to drill down into details with modals or overlay panels.

Navigation & User Flow:

For teachers, design a multi-pane layout with a fixed navigation sidebar for quick access to testbanks, quizzes, and analytics.

For test takers, focus on a single-column layout that minimizes distractions and facilitates smooth exam navigation.
