Computer adaptive testing (CAT) models dynamically adjust the difficulty of test questions based on a test-taker's responses, aiming to pinpoint their ability level more efficiently and accurately than traditional fixed-form tests. These models rely on item response theory (IRT) and algorithms that select items from a large item bank to maximize information about the test-taker's ability. 
Key Concepts and Models:
Item Response Theory (IRT):
.
IRT is a statistical framework used to model the relationship between a test-taker's ability and their responses to test items. It allows for estimating both the examinee's ability and the characteristics of the test items (difficulty, discrimination, and guessing). 
Item Bank:
.
CAT models require a large pool of calibrated items with known characteristics (difficulty, discrimination, etc.) according to IRT. 
Adaptive Algorithm:
.
The algorithm determines which item to present next based on the test-taker's previous responses and the IRT model. It aims to select items that provide the most information about the test-taker's ability at their current estimated level. 
Ability Estimation:
.
As the test progresses, the CAT system continuously updates its estimate of the test-taker's ability based on their responses. This allows for a more precise estimate of their true ability compared to traditional tests. 
How CAT Models Work:
1. Initial Item Selection:
.
The test begins with an item of moderate difficulty. 
2. Response Evaluation:
.
The test-taker's response to the item is evaluated, and their ability estimate is updated. 
3. Next Item Selection:
.
Based on the updated ability estimate and the IRT model, the algorithm selects the next item from the item bank. If the previous answer was correct, the next item will be slightly more difficult. If incorrect, the next item will be easier. 
4. Iteration:
.
This process of presenting items, evaluating responses, and selecting new items continues until a predetermined stopping rule is met, such as reaching a desired level of precision in the ability estimate. 
Advantages of CAT Models:
Increased Efficiency:
CAT can reduce testing time by focusing on items relevant to the test-taker's ability level, eliminating unnecessary items that are too easy or too difficult. 
Enhanced Precision:
By adapting to the individual's ability, CAT can provide a more precise estimate of their knowledge and skills. 
Improved Security:
Each test is tailored to the individual, making it more difficult to cheat or share answers. 
Reduced Test Anxiety:
By presenting items at an appropriate difficulty level, CAT can reduce test anxiety and improve the test-taking experience. 
Cost-Effective:
While requiring an initial investment in item banking and software, CAT can lead to cost savings in the long run through reduced testing time and resources. 
Types of Adaptive Testing:
Question-Level Adaptive Testing:
.
Each question's difficulty depends on the response to the previous question (e.g., Smarter Balanced, MAP).
Multistage Adaptive Testing:
.
Test-takers answer sets of questions, and the difficulty of each set depends on their performance on the previous set (e.g., SAT, PSAT).
