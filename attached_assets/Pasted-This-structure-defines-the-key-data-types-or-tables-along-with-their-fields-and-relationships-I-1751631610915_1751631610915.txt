This structure defines the key data types (or “tables”) along with their fields and relationships. In Bubble, you’ll create these as custom data types and use fields (with appropriate types) to connect them. Adjustments may be needed based on testing and evolving requirements, but this serves as a robust starting point.

Relationships and Considerations
Relational Links:

Many data types reference the User type for creators, reviewers, and participants.

Testbanks are the parent containers for Questions, and Questions link back to their parent Testbank.

Quizzes can pull questions either directly from a testbank or via individually selected items, ensuring flexibility in exam creation.

Quiz Results and Quiz Response Items connect individual student performance to the respective quiz and questions.

Validation Logs, Revisions, and Peer Reviews are attached to specific Questions to maintain a complete audit trail.

Flexibility for Advanced Features:

Use Option sets (for roles, question types, resource types) to maintain consistency across records.

For complex or question-type–specific data, consider an “Additional Data” field in JSON format so you can store dynamic configurations without cluttering the main schema.

Maintain lists (arrays) of related items (e.g., Questions within a Testbank, Notifications for a User) using Bubble’s built-in “list of” field type.
